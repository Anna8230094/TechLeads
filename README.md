# Hire&Go

## Project Description

**Hire&Go** is a software application designed to optimize the candidate selection process in businesses by leveraging AI assistants. It efficiently ranks resumes based on their suitability for a specific job position. 

The process of using the application is as follows:
1. **Complete the form**: The user (company representative) provides their details and specifies the job position.
2. **Attach resumes**: Users upload resumes to the form (preferred formats: `.doc` and `.pdf`).
3. **Resume ranking**: The system uses OpenAI assistants to rank resumes based on their relevance.
4. **Results delivery**: An email is sent to the user containing a link to a webpage where the ranked resumes can be reviewed.
